# PRODIGY_SD_01
 Task - 1

Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.

What does this program do?
  This  program seamlessly converts temperatures between Celsius,Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

How does this program work?
1. Input: The user is prompted to enter the temperature value and the original unit of measurement.
2. Conversion: The program then converts the temperature to the other two units.
3. Output: The program prints out the converted temperature values.
